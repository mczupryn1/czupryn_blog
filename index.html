      <h2>Snowy Mountain Cookies</h2>
      <h3>Total Time Prep: 20 min. + chilling Bake: 10 min./batch. + cooling</h3>
      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <p>4 cups butter, softened</p>
        <p>cup sugar</p>
        <p>2 large eggs, room temperature</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1 package (10 ounces) miniature semisweet chocolate chips</p>
        <p>1 cup finely chopped walnuts, optional</p>
        <p>1 package (10 to 12 ounces) white baking chips</p>
        <p>White nonpareils</p>
        <h4>Directions:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk flour and salt; gradually beat into creamed mixture. Add chocolate chips and, if desired, walnuts; mix well. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until firm enough to roll, about 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Preheat oven to 325Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion of dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a floured 2-in. triangle-shaped cookie cutter. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake until edges begin to brown, 10-12 minutes. Cool on pans 2 minutes. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, in a microwave, melt white baking chips; stir until smooth. Dip cookie tops in melted chips; sprinkle with nonpareils. Let stand until set.</li>

      <p>I am a senior at the University of Florida studying advertising and political science. I have a part-time job as a nanny, and I am starting my master's in web design next year. </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, I am very busy, as almost everyone is nowadays. Time is precious, and ensuring you have time for your hobbies can start to seem more of a chore than an enjoyable pasttime.
        I've always enjoyed baking but found that so many recipes can be long and difficult, which is why I decided to make a blog about easy recipes that fit into my schedule while indulging in my 
        valuable (and delicious!) hobby. I hope my posts can help others who have a love for baking but feel that they need easier, quicker recipes to fit their hectic schedule.
